    WHY CURZON TRAVEL ?
    How we work?

    Once you have called us or completed our enquiry form, we will provide you with a
    detailed quotation and itinerary for your tour holiday. Our holiday tours have been
    designed to maximise your experience from travelling and use all of our experience of
    the destinations.

    Yes, you can read hundreds of online reviews about hotels and destinations and try to
    figure it out yourself, but there is nothing like talking to experts who have actually been there.

    Once you have reviewed the quotation, you accept the terms and we confirm the booking.

    One price

    Once we have put your holiday together and you are 100% happy with the quote, we will
    make all the necessary arrangements, with the airlines, hotels, transport and experience
    providers. The price of your holiday with us is fixed and we will pay each supplier rather
    than you having to settle with each one directly during your stay in local currency.

    Preferred Rates

    We negotiate preferential rates with all our suppliers, which means that the price you
    pay is usually as good or better as booking and settling directly. Plus you have the assurance
    that should there be any hiccups along the way (the wrong room type, a missed connection etc),
    then we are there to help sort them out.

    Total Peace of Mind

    Your holiday with us is also protected under the ATOL scheme.
